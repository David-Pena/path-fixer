## üß© Use Cases

There is only one use-case which I aim to handle with this tool.

Sometimes I need to `copy` a relative or full path and use it as input to some other tool or process. All path from the `file-explorer` in windows have the following structure `path\to\some\file\somewhere` so I just paste it and manually replace the `\` with `/`.

This tool takes care of that. That's it üëå

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you have any other case where this toll would be useful, please let me know how I can improve it.
